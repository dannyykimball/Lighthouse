# Lighthouse - Final Project for CS546
Reflecting on our time at Stevens, we’ve found that in order to run a successful course, communication among instructors and students is paramount. The team has used several platforms for course communication at Stevens: Slack, Piazza, Canvas discussions, and more.  While all of them have their merits, they all fall into some familiar problems:  too clunky, outdated UI,or hard to sort through.  Lighthouse is our attempt at building a solution that is easy to use and quick in getting you the answer you need.

While platforms like Slack and Piazza are normally perfectly viable solutions,  once the frequency of questions being asked increases,  it becomes arduous to dig through all conversation threads and becomes much easier to simply ask a question without looking at previous threads, even if it might be a duplicate.  What this ends up doing is it just adds to the sheer amount of  conversation  threads  to  sort  through  and  makes  it  harder  for  the  next person to find what they’re looking for.  Thus, the cycle continues.  Lighthouse aims to combat the problem of scale through auto-tagging features and identifying similar questions before submission and redirecting them to questions that might be able to solve their problem
